"""Command-line interface.

The Phase 1 ingestion and scan commands, `run-scan` which chains them, and the
Phase 2 scoring and ranking commands. Each is thin: build the dependencies, call
into `scanning` or `scoring`, print the outcome. Any logic worth testing lives in
a module, not in a command body.

Commands write their results to stdout with `typer.echo` rather than a logger.
The table and the summary are the program's *output*, not diagnostics — they
belong on stdout whatever the log level, and they should stay legible when logs
are being emitted as JSON.
