"""Command-line interface.

Five commands mirroring the Phase 1 workflow, plus `run-scan` which chains them.
Each is thin: build the dependencies, call into `scanning`, print the outcome.
Any logic worth testing lives in a module, not in a command body.

Commands write their results to stdout with `typer.echo` rather than a logger.
The table and the summary are the program's *output*, not diagnostics — they
belong on stdout whatever the log level, and they should stay legible when logs
are being emitted as JSON.
